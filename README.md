# Meas_Quechua_coartic
Measure and analyze child and adult coarticulatory patterns via mel frequency spectra. Repo contains scripts and data necessary to replicate analyses in Cychosz (2020) (https://psyarxiv.com/26uyb). 

## Acoustic measures

**get_mel_spec_bythirds.py** - option to compute coarticulation spectrally (spectral distance) by taking spectra from middle third of two adjacent phones and computing average spectrum from each phone; also computes phone and word duration; generates filename+`mel_spectrum.csv` which can be read into R for post-processing

To execute this script:

1. In terminal, move inside of corpus directory that contains .wav and .TextGrid files _with corresponding names_  

 ```python
cd specify/directory/location/corpus_directory
```
2. Run script over entire directory

 ```python
  python3 specify/file/location/get_mel_spec_bythirds.py walk
```

## Data analysis

**1_rename_participants.R** - gives participants anonymous IDs; not included in repo as it contains deanonymized participant information; generates `thirds_CV.anonymized.csv`

**2_map_words_modified.R** - reads in `thirds_CV.anonymized.csv`; selects word environments; calculates Euclidean distance between spectral vectors; modified version that does not include deanonymized participant information is included in repo; generates `mapped_words_anonymized.csv` 

**3_ch3_results.Rmd** - reads in `mapped_words_anonymized.csv`; generates Results section of paper

## Output

**3_ch3_results.pdf** - compiled results section from 3_ch3_results.Rmd

**3_ch3_results.tex** - tex source of results section from 3_ch3_results.Rmd

**Quechua_coartic_manuscript.pdf** - compiled paper, including Results section

**Quechua_coartic_manuscript_source.tex** - tex source of Quechua_coartic_manuscript.pdf

**3_ch3_results_files/** - directory containing figures generated by 3_ch3_results.Rmd

## Data

`thirds_CV.anonymized` - dataframe generated by 1_rename_participants.R

`mapped_words_anonymized.csv` - dataframe generated 2_map_words_modified.R; required to compile 3_ch3_results.Rmd (Results)

## Additional code in this repo

**coartic_as_transition.py** - option to compute coarticulation temporally (more dynamic); one technique used to measure coarticulation in Cychosz et al. (2019)

**get_mel_spec.py** - option to compute coarticulation spectrally (spectral distance); one technique used to measure coarticulation in Cychosz et al. (2019)
